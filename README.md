# Research-Square---Question
Please write a program that simulates and outputs the result of 100 rolls of a fair 20-sided die. What is your estimate for the average of those roles (including the standard deviation of that estimated average)? What is your estimate for the expected value of a single roll of a 20-sided die (including the standard deviation of that expected value)? Briefly explain why the two estimates are or are not the same.
